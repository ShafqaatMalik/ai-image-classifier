# AI-based Image Classifier for an E-commerce Retailer

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify product images for an e-commerce retailer. The model is trained and evaluated on the FashionMNIST dataset, which contains various clothing item images, simulating a real-world retail scenario.

## Features
- Uses PyTorch and TorchMetrics for model development and evaluation
- Loads and preprocesses FashionMNIST dataset
- Defines a custom CNN architecture
- Trains the model for multiclass classification
- Evaluates accuracy, precision, and recall (overall and per class)

## Model Architecture
- **Feature Extractor:**
  - 2 convolutional layers (32 and 64 filters)
  - ELU activation
  - Max pooling
  - Flatten layer
- **Classifier:**
  - Fully connected layer for 10 classe

## Results
The notebook prints overall and per-class accuracy, precision, and recall after model evaluation.
